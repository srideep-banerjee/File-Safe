# File-Safe
File Safe provides a secure way to store files and prevents hackers from accessing those files through encryption.<br>
It also supports multiple users and automatic login through face recognition.<br>
This project uses a java based implementation of OpenCV called [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv).
